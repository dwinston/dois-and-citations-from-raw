# Get DOIs and Citations

This repo contains a workflow for maintaining files of DOIs and of
properly-formatted citations for distinct sets of publications. The iPython
Notebook
[get_dois_and_citations.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/dwinston/dois-and-citations-from-raw/blob/master/get_dois_and_citations.ipynb)
describes and facilitates this workflow, which is used to maintain a list of
[references](https://materialsproject.org/wiki/index.php/References) for the
[Materials Project (MP)](https://materialsproject.org) that is separated into
two sets of publications: those done/supported by the MP Center (persisting to
"center" files) those done by MP users that acknowledge MP resources
(persisting to "user" files).
